1. No input validation or sanitization is performed on the "message" variable before it is sent to the receiver window. This could allow for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

2. The "SERVER_DOMAIN" variable is not properly validated or sanitized, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.

3. The "window_ref" variable is not used, making it unclear why it is included in the code.

4. The "sendMessageButton" event listener should also include a check to ensure that the "message" field is not empty or too long before sending the message.
