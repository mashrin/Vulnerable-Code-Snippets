One security vulnerability in the code is the lack of proper error handling. The code assumes that the file specified by the path parameter exists and can be read, which may not always be true. If the file does not exist or cannot be read due to permission issues, the function `readFile()` will throw an exception that is not handled. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential denial-of-service attacks if the exception is not caught properly.

Another vulnerability is the use of user-supplied input in the `readFile()` function without proper input validation and sanitization. The `path` parameter can potentially contain arbitrary user input, which may include special characters and escape sequences that can be used to manipulate the file system and execute arbitrary code. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure and remote code execution vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the input.

Finally, the code does not enforce any authentication or authorization mechanisms, which means that anyone can access the `books` query and potentially read sensitive information from the data source. This can lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
