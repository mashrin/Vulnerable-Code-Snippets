Potential Security Vulnerabilities:
1. No input validation: The code directly uses the values of $_GET['file'] and $_GET['content'] without checking their values. This makes the code vulnerable to various injection attacks such as directory traversal attacks, code injection attacks or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

2. Insecure file handling: The code writes to a file "/some/path/$file" without ensuring that the file path exists or that the file is not already being used by another process. This can lead to race conditions, resulting in file tampering or file system damage.

3. Missing error handling: If the file_put_contents() function fails to write the contents of the file, there is no error handling in place to alert the system or the user of the problem. 

4. fclose() function closes an unknown file handle $fh, which does not exist in the code snippet provided. 

Suggestions to Improve Security:
1. Validate input: The code should sanitize the input values of $_GET['file'] and $_GET['content'] with proper filter functions to avoid injection attacks.

2. Secure file handling: The code should first check if the file path exists and create it if it does not exist. The code should also use a unique filename to avoid overwriting of existing files. The unlink() function should be used in order to release the resource that is attached to the file.

3. Handling errors: Proper error handling should be implemented to handle situations such as a failed file write operation. The code should log any errors encountered to assist in troubleshooting issues.

4. Remove unnecessary code: Remove the fclose() line as it does not reference an open file handle in this code snippet.
