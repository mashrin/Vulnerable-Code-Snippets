There are a few security vulnerabilities in this code snippet:

1. Input validation is not sufficient. The code reads the file specified by the query parameter 'name', but it doesn't check whether the file path is valid or safe. This means that an attacker could potentially provide a malicious filename and execute arbitrary code on the server.

2. Error handling is not sufficient. If the 'readFile' function encounters an error, it will throw an exception that is not caught or handled. This means that the server will crash, which could provide an attacker with valuable information about the server's configuration and vulnerabilities.

3. The 'readFileSync' function is used instead of the asynchronous 'readFile' function. This could potentially lead to performance issues if there are many simultaneous requests, and it doesn't allow for parallel processing.

To address these vulnerabilities, the code should be modified to include proper input validation and error handling. Additionally, the 'readFile' function should be replaced with the asynchronous 'readFile' function. Here's an example of how the code could be modified:

const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000
const fs = require('fs')

app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  const filePath = req.query.name;
  
  // Validate input
  if (!filePath || !fs.existsSync(filePath)) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid file path');
  }

  // Read file asynchronously
  fs.readFile(filePath, (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      return next(err);
    }
    
    // Send file contents as response
    res.send(data.toString());
  });
});

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err);
  res.status(500).send('Internal server error');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
})
