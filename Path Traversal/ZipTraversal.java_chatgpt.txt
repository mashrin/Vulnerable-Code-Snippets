1. Directory Traversal vulnerability: The code does not check if the zip file contains any "../" or "..." sequences in the zipEntry.getName() before creating a new File object. This could potentially lead to unauthorized extraction of files to locations outside the intended target directory, if an attacker is able to manipulate the zip file.

2. Resource Leak vulnerability: The code opens an InputStream and a BufferedOutputStream for each ZipEntry, but does not close them explicitly, which can lead to resource leaks and exhaustion of system resources. It is recommended to use try-with-resources or finally blocks to close the InputStream and the BufferedOutputStream.

3. Path Traversal vulnerability: The code uses a hardcoded target directory "/my/target/directory/", which could allow an attacker to use a symlink or other malicious redirection to access or overwrite target files on the system.

4. Zip Slip vulnerability: The code does not check for any "zip slip" related issues which occur when an attacker places files outside of the expected extraction folder as part of a zip archive. This can lead to malicious files being extracted to unexpected destinations on the system.

Therefore, it is recommended to implement proper input validation and secure coding practices to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
