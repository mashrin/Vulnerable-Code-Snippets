The security vulnerability in the given code is Path Traversal. The `Test` method takes a `string` parameter `path` and calls the `File.Delete` method, which can delete any file on the server's file system accessible to the application's process. An attacker can craft a request to specify a path outside of the directory intended for deletion using "../" or "..\" characters in the `path` parameter to perform directory traversal attacks. 

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should not accept user-provided input as-is and should sanitize and validate it before using it. One way to do this is to check if the path string contains any invalid characters, such as slashes or colons that could allow traversal to parent directories. Another approach is to restrict the paths allowed to be deleted to a specific directory using a whitelist. 

Additionally, the code should also ensure that the file being deleted is not a critical system file, and the user has the necessary permissions to delete it. It is also recommended to use file deletion methods that require elevated permissions or use the appropriate security settings to restrict the file operations to a specific user or group.
