There is a Path Traversal vulnerability in this code. The user input is directly concatenated with the RootFolder without any validation, which means that an attacker could potentially manipulate the user input and access or modify files outside of the intended directory. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive information or even data corruption. 

To mitigate this vulnerability, a proper input validation and sanitization should be implemented before concatenating with the file path. One way to achieve this is to use Path.Combine method, which will automatically take care of any backslashes and forward slashes in the user input, and ensure that the resulting path is within the intended directory. Another solution is to use regular expressions to match the expected input, and reject any input that does not match the expected pattern.
