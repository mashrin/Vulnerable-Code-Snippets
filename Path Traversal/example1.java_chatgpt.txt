There are two security vulnerabilities in this code snippet:

1. Input Validation: The code does not validate the input provided by the user, which means an attacker can enter a path outside of "/safe_dir/" and delete any file they want, potentially causing damage or accessing sensitive information.

2. File Deletion: The code blindly deletes the file provided by the user without any confirmation or verification, which can lead to unintentional file deletion or exploitation by an attacker.
