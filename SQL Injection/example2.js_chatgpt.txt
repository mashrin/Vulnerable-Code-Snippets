1. Lack of options definition: The variable "options" is not defined in the code snippet, hence it is unclear what options are being passed to the http request.
2. SQL Injection: The variable "valTom" is concatenated directly into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the "valTom" variable, which may compromise the security of the database.
3. Information disclosure: The error message produced by the console.log statement in case of an error exposes sensitive information to the attacker, such as the SQL query that caused the error.
4. Lack of secure connections: The code does not use encrypted connections while connecting to the database or making HTTP requests, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. 

To fix these issues:
1. Define "options" or explicitly specify it in the http.request options parameter.
2. Use parameterized queries or escape the values passed in the SQL query to prevent SQL injection.
3. Avoid logging sensitive information in the console or any other output channel.
4. Use secure connections such as HTTPS for HTTP requests, and encrypted connections such as SSL/TLS for database connections.
