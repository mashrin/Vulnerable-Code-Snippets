The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it does not properly sanitize user input before using it in an SQL query. An attacker could supply malicious input in the GET parameter 'id' to manipulate the query and access or modify data in the database. The code also returns a blind response, making it easy for an attacker to guess the contents of the database table based on the server's response.
