One security vulnerability in this code snippet is there is no parameterized query used in the sequelize.query() statement, which can lead to SQL injection attacks. An attacker can manipulate the input to execute arbitrary SQL commands to the underlying database.

To fix this, we should use prepared statements or parameterized queries to escape user input and avoid SQL injection attacks. For example, we can modify the sequelize.query() statement as follows:

```
sequelize.query('SELECT * FROM Products WHERE name LIKE ?', {
  replacements: [req.body.username],
  type: sequelize.QueryTypes.SELECT
})
``` 

This code snippet uses a parameterized query using '?' as a placeholder for the user input and uses sequelize.QueryTypes.SELECT to specify the query type. The replacements array contains the user input, which is properly escaped and avoided any SQL injection attacks.
