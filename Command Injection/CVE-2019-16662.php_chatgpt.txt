4. It is not recommended to use sudo without proper authentication and authorization checks.
5. Display of error messages directly on the webpage can provide valuable information for attackers, such as the possible presence of vulnerabilities in the system or about user accounts.
6. Insecure file permissions can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or unauthorized execution of code.
7. The code should use prepared statements or stored procedures to prevent SQL injection attacks.
8. The code should validate and sanitize all user input to prevent directory traversal attacks. 
9. The code should properly authenticate and authorize users before granting them permissions to run sensitive commands. 
10. The code should avoid displaying detailed error messages to prevent information leakage. 
11. The code should use secure file permissions to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
