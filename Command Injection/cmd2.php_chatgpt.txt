In the given code, the security vulnerability is in the use of `system` function to execute the content of `$_POST["cmd"]` without any sanitization or validation of input provided via the form. This can allow an attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application, leading to unauthorized access and control of the system. 

To address this issue, the input provided via the form should be validated and sanitized to ensure that it only contains valid and expected values. Additionally, instead of using the `system` function, a safer alternative such as `escapeshellarg()` and `exec()` functions should be used to execute the command with proper arguments and proper escaping of malicious characters.
