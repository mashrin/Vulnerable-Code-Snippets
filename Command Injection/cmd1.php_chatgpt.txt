Potential security vulnerabilities in the code snippet are as follows:

1. Code Injection: The code snippet executes shell commands based on the value passed via the GET request parameter. This is problematic since it introduces a code injection vulnerability. An attacker could craft a malicious command and pass it via the "cmd" parameter, resulting in possible privilege escalation, data theft, or damage to the system.

2. Lack of Input Validation & Escaping: The code doesn't validate or sanitize the input passed via the "cmd" parameter. Any malicious code passed as input could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the system. 

3. Insecure Include: The code contains an `include` statement that includes the `header.php` file from a relative path. If the path is not validated, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a Local File Inclusion (LFI) or Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attack to include malicious code from an external source.

To improve the code's security, the following measures could be taken:

1. Avoid using user input in shell command arguments. Instead, use a whitelist of allowed commands or functions and sanitize user input using input validation, escaping, and filtering techniques such as htmlentities(), strip_tags(), or htmlspecialchars().

2. Put restrictions on the commands that the script can execute. If possible, avoid allowing users to run arbitrary commands. Use a whitelist of allowed commands, or provide a set of pre-defined commands to users to choose from.

3. Sanitize user input by applying regular expressions, limiting the input length, and restricting special characters.

4. Use absolute paths instead of relative paths in the `include` statements, and avoid including user input in the file path. 

5. Implement effective access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources.

6. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to secure the website against cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks.
