The security vulnerability in this code is the use of the os.system() method with unsanitized user input. The attacker can potentially inject malicious commands into the request.remote_addr attribute, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This can result in a variety of consequences, including data theft, data destruction or unauthorized access. It's important to always sanitize and validate user input before using it in any command or query.
