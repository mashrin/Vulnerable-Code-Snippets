Potential security vulnerabilities:
- The code includes multiple files using "require_once", but it's unclear if the paths to these files are secure and not accessible to unauthorized users. Without proper access controls, attackers could potentially view sensitive code or data.
- The code checks if the user is logged in by checking the "$session->logged_in" variable, but it's unclear where this variable is set or how the user session is managed. There may be other security issues with the user authentication process.
- The code outputs potentially sensitive information in the "echo" statement, including the fact that a hack attempt was logged. This could provide information to attackers and make it easier for them to plan future attacks.
- The code uses user input (in the form of the $_GET['searchTerm'], $_GET['catId'], $_GET['catCommand'], $_GET['nodeId'], $_GET['numLinesStr'], and $_GET['noLines'] variables) without properly validating or sanitizing it. This could allow attackers to inject malicious code or perform SQL injection attacks.
