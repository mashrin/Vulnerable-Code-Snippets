The code snippet has the following security vulnerabilities:
- The code includes a header file without sanitizing input, which could lead to Remote File Inclusion vulnerabilities.
- The hint function should not be used in production code, as it provides information an attacker could use.
- The code does not sanitize the input from the form, which could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
- The system function executes the user input as a command, which is extremely dangerous and could lead to arbitrary code execution.
