Potential security vulnerability in the code snippet:

1. Lack of input validation: The code allows any value to be passed as the "id" parameter in the "tstMe" route without validation. This can lead to injection attacks, such as SQL injection, by malicious users who can manipulate the input to cause unintended consequences.

2. Regular expression vulnerability: The regular expression used in the code may be susceptible to denial of service attacks, as it does not impose any limits on the size of the input. This can lead to a significant slowdown or even crashing of the application.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the code should include appropriate input validation, such as data type and length validation, and impose limits on the regular expression input to prevent DoS attacks.
