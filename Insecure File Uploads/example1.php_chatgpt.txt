One possible security vulnerability in this code is the lack of input validation for the uploaded file. An attacker could potentially upload a malicious file, such as a script that could be executed on the server, leading to a security breach.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should perform file type and size checks before allowing the upload to proceed. Additionally, the uploaded file should be stored outside of the web root directory to prevent unauthorized access.
