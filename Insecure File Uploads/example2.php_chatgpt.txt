There are no evident security vulnerabilities in this code, but there are some possible improvements that could enhance its security. 

Firstly, it's recommended to validate the file content and not only the file extension and size. Attackers could disguise malicious code as legitimate images, so it's crucial to ensure that the file is indeed an image. One useful technique is to use file-type detection libraries, such as finfo or mime_content_type, to verify if the file is an image.

Additionally, the code could benefit from tweaking the file permissions after uploading. The uploaded file should only be accessible by the webserver and not publicly. Modifying the file permission to remove public access helps prevent unauthorized access to the uploaded files. 

Lastly, the code could include a feature to prevent file overwriting by attackers. Attackers could replace legitimate files with malicious ones under the same name. Therefore, it's advisable to use unique names for each uploaded file.
