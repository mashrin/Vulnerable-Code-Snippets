Potential vulnerabilities:

1. Insufficient validation: The code only checks if the filename is in a whitelist before saving the file to the server. This means that a malicious user could upload a file with a valid filename to bypass the check and upload a file with malicious content.

2. Insecure file upload: The code does not perform sufficient checks on the uploaded file to prevent malicious data from being uploaded or executed on the server. This could lead to issues, such as file injection, directory traversal or remote code execution.

3. Hardcoded directory: The code uses a hardcoded directory to store uploaded files, which could be guessed by an attacker or even used to overwrite existing files.

4. Lack of error handling: The code does not handle errors that may occur during file upload or file saving. This could lead to unexpected behavior, such as files being overwritten or deleted unintentionally.

5. Lack of access control: The code does not implement access controls on who can upload files or download them. This could lead to unauthorized access, data leakage or other security issues.
