Security Vulnerabilities:
- The code allows for untrusted input to be provided via the command line using $argv[1] parameter, which is directly used in the unserialize() function. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code and gain unauthorized access to the system.
- The system() function executed in the __wakeup() magic method also allows for command execution, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
