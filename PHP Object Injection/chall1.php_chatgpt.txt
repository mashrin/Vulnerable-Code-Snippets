1. The security vulnerability in this code is that the "__destruct" function is deleting a file based on a variable provided by the user. This could potentially allow an attacker to delete arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the input.

2. Additionally, the use of $_GET to unserialize user-provided data could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by submitting crafted input. It is recommended to use a more secure method of input validation and data sanitization, such as whitelisting allowed values or using a dedicated PHP input filtering library.
