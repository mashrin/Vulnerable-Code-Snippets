There are a few security vulnerabilities in this code snippet:

1. The code is using a hard-coded username, password, and role. This can make it easier for attackers to guess the credentials and gain unauthorized access.
2. The code is using the serialize() function to create a string representation of the login object. This can make it easier for attackers to manipulate the data.
3. The code is using the unserialize() function to rebuild the login object from the serialized string. This can lead to deserialization vulnerabilities, where attackers can execute arbitrary code or read sensitive data by injecting malicious input into the unserialize() function.
4. The code is comparing the role property to the string "ADMIN", which can be manipulated by attackers to bypass the access control check.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the code should use secure and unpredictable credentials, avoid using the serialize() and unserialize() functions, and use a safer method to compare the role property. Additionally, input validation should be implemented to prevent attackers from injecting malicious data into the script.
