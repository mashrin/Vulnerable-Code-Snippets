1. Integer overflow: The variable size1 is assigned the sum of img.width and img.height, which can result in an integer overflow if both values are sufficiently large.

2. No data buffer size/malloc success check: The memcpy function copies data from img.data to buff1 without checking if the size of img.data is larger than buff1 or if the malloc function has allocated memory correctly.

3. Double free: The if statement following the memcpy function checks if size1 divided by 2 is equal to zero. If it is true, then the function attempts to free the buff1 pointer, but buff1 has already been freed in the if statement before. Thus, this is a double-free vulnerability.

4. Use after free: If size1 is equal to 123456, then buff1[0] is assigned the value 'a', which is a use after free vulnerability since buff1 has been freed in the previous if statement.

5. Integer underflow: The variable size2 is assigned the difference between img.width and img.height, which can result in an integer underflow if img.height is greater than img.width.

6. Out of bound read: The char variable OOBR_stack is assigned buff3[size3+100]. This can result in an out-of-bound read vulnerability because the size of buff3 is only 10, but the program tries to access elements beyond its bounds.

7. Out of bound write: The char variable OOBR_heap is assigned buff4[100]. This can result in an out-of-bound write vulnerability because the memory allocated for buff4 may not be large enough to hold data beyond the first 100 bytes.

8. Memory leak: If size3 is greater than 10, the pointer buff4 is set to 0 without being freed first, resulting in a memory leak. 

In summary, the code is susceptible to integer overflow/underflow, memory leaks, use-after-free, double-free, and out-of-bound read/write vulnerabilities that can be fixed by careful programming and input validation.
