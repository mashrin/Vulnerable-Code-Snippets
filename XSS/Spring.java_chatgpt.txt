One potential vulnerability in this code could be a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. Since the "name" parameter is taken directly from the request parameter and added to the response body, there's a possibility that a malicious user could inject malicious scripts or code and execute it on the user's browser when they view the response. 

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code could use input validation and sanitation techniques to ensure that any user input is free of any malicious code. For example, the code could use Spring's HtmlUtils library to escape or sanitize user inputs before using them in the response.
