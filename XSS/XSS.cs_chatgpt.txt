Security vulnerability:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to directly injecting the user input `userInfo` into the response body without proper encoding or validation.

Possible fix:
- Encode the user input using HTML encoding to prevent XSS attacks. For example, use `HttpUtility.HtmlEncode` method in .NET to encode the input. 
- Use input validation to check for any malicious content or patterns in the input, and reject or sanitize it if necessary. 
- Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) header to further restrict the content that can be loaded by the browser.
