Potential vulnerabilities in this code include:

1. Unsanitized user input: The code uses $_GET['name'] directly in the HTML without sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious content or scripts into the page.

2. Insecure file inclusion: The code includes a file from ../_helpers/strip.php without verifying the path, which could allow an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.

3. JavaScript injection: The code creates a new script element and sets its source to someObject.url without validating or sanitizing the input. An attacker could potentially modify the URL to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.

To address these vulnerabilities, the code should:

1. Sanitize user input (e.g. using htmlspecialchars() or htmlentities()) before displaying it on the page, or better yet, use a template engine that automatically escapes user input.

2. Verify all file paths and include files using absolute paths instead of relative ones.

3. Validate and sanitize all user input, especially when building URLs or dynamically executing scripts. Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of content that can be loaded on the page.
