The code snippet doesn't contain any apparent security vulnerabilities. However, it's important to ensure that the source of the message is legitimate and trustworthy to prevent malicious code injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. 

Possible safeguards to include:

1. Validate the source of the message: Only accept messages from a trusted origin using the `event.origin` property. 

2. Sanitize input data: Ensure that the message content is sanitized to prevent any malicious content from being injected into the webpage using a DOM-based output encoding approach. 

3. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP): to limit the sources of executable scripts and prevent XSS attacks. 

Overall, the code snippet seems secure but ensure proper security practices are followed to improve security.
