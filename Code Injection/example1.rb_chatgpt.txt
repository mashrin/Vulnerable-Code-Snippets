Possible vulnerabilities in the code snippet:

1. Command injection: The eval function can execute arbitrary code, so if an attacker could control the input arguments (e.g. by passing shell metacharacters), they could inject malicious commands and execute them on the system. To prevent this, the code should validate and sanitize the input arguments, e.g. by checking that they are numeric and within a safe range.

2. Information disclosure: The code reveals the raw input arguments in the output, which could leak sensitive information such as passwords, tokens, or filenames. To avoid this, the code should mask or obfuscate the input, e.g. by hashing it or truncating it to a fixed length.

3. Lack of input validation: The code assumes that the input arguments are always present and valid, but this may not be the case in practice. If the user forgets to supply one or both arguments, the script will raise an error (TypeError: nil can't be coerced into Integer) and expose the underlying implementation details. To handle this gracefully, the code should check the input for null or empty values, and handle them with an appropriate error message or default value.
