1. The inclusion of the strip.php file is not relevant, and it may contain security vulnerabilities that could compromise the application.
2. The code doesn't sanitize the input received through the GET parameter 'xml', leaving it open to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection attacks.
3. The libxml_disable_entity_loader (false) function enables the entity loader, which could lead to XXE injection vulnerabilities if unsanitized input is used.
4. The use of LIBXML_NOENT and LIBXML_DTDLOAD flags in the loadXML function makes the code vulnerable to XXE injection attacks if unsanitized input is used.

To fix these issues, we need to:
- Remove the unnecessary strip.php file inclusion
- Sanitize the 'xml' input parameter by checking for malicious code and disallowing the use of external entities
- Disable the entity loader through libxml_disable_entity_loader (true)
- Use the LIBXML_NONET flag instead of the LIBXML_NOENT and LIBXML_DTDLOAD flags to mitigate XXE injection vulnerabilities.
