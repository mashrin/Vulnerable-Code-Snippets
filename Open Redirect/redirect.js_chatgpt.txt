1. The code does not have any security vulnerabilities per se, but it seems incomplete ("WIP" in console log) and lacks authentication/authorization logic to protect sensitive routes and operations.
2. There is a potential security vulnerability in the second route ("/goto") where the user input (query parameter "url") is directly used to construct a redirect URL without proper validation and sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious redirects or phishing URLs. The code should validate the URL format and check for any blacklisted or suspicious domains before allowing the redirection. It's also a good practice to use the "rel=noopener" attribute on external links to prevent tab hijacking attacks.
