There is a potential security vulnerability in the code snippet. The "params" variable is being directly modified without proper validation or sanitization, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious payloads into the URL and perform various types of attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). 

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement proper input validation and sanitization where possible or using a framework's built-in security features to prevent unauthorized modifications to the params variable.
