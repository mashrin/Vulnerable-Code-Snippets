1. The variable "zipPath" is defined twice: one with a hardcoded value and another is input from the user. This may cause confusion and potential errors.

2. The user input for "zipPath" is not sanitized, potentially allowing for directory traversal attacks.

3. The extracted files may overwrite existing files in the destination folder, which may cause unintended consequences.

4. There is no error handling for possible exceptions that may arise during the file extraction process.

5. The code does not verify the authenticity or integrity of the zip archive before extracting its contents, which may lead to the execution of malicious code.
