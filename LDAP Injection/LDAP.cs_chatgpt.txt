The security vulnerability in the code is the concatenation of user input (variable "user") directly into an LDAP search filter. This can potentially allow for LDAP injection attacks where an attacker sends specially crafted input to modify or retrieve data from the LDAP server. To fix this vulnerability, input validation and parameterized queries should be implemented.
