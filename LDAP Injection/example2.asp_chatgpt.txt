1. The LDAP server name is hardcoded, which can be exploited if the server location changes.
2. The user input from the QueryString is not sanitized, which can lead to injection attacks.
3. There is no input validation on the user input, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
4. The code does not authenticate the user before allowing access to LDAP data.
5. The final "Response.Write" statement is not inside the loop, which will result in an error.
