There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in these code snippets since they simply define two variables with string values. However, it's important to note that hardcoding passwords in code is generally not a recommended practice, especially in cases where the code might be visible to others (e.g. open source projects, shared repositories, etc.). Instead, passwords should be stored securely and accessed via secure mechanisms such as environment variables or a secure vault.
