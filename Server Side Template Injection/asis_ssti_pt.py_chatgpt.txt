1. The code executes two external files, `flag.py` and `key.py`, which may contain sensitive information. This should be avoided as it can lead to unauthorized access to this information.

2. In the `golem` function, the value of the `golem` variable is sanitized by removing certain characters. This may not be enough to prevent various types of injection attacks such as SQL Injection, XSS, etc. A better approach would be to use a suitable library or framework for input validation.

3. In the `golem` function, the `template` variable is constructed using a string format function with the value of `session['golem']` as the argument. This is risky because if the value of `session['golem']` contains any special characters, it may cause a syntax error or string injection attack. A better approach would be to use templating engines such as Jinja which provide a safer way to render dynamic content.

4. In the `article` function, the value of the `page` variable is taken from the query string parameters without proper validation. This can lead to directory traversal attacks, where an attacker can view arbitrary files on the server. A better approach would be to validate the value of `page` against a whitelist or filter out any unwanted characters.

5. In the `article` function, the code checks if the value of `page` contains the word "flag", and if so, it sets `page` to `'notallowed.txt'`. This is not a reliable way to prevent access to sensitive files as an attacker can simply modify the URL to bypass this check. A better approach would be to use proper access control mechanisms to limit access to sensitive files.

6. The `debug` mode is set to `False` in the `__main__` block, but it should be set to `True` only in development environments as it can leak sensitive information and weaken security.
