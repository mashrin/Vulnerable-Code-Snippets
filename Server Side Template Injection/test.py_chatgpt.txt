One potential security vulnerability in this code is that the input from the 'name' parameter in the GET request is directly used in creating the 'renderer' object without proper input validation or sanitization. This could potentially allow for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, where an attacker injects malicious code into the 'name' parameter that could then be executed by unsuspecting users visiting the page. 

To address this vulnerability, proper input validation and sanitization should be implemented before using user input in creating the 'renderer' object. For example, using a library like bleach to sanitize the input and remove any potentially malicious code would be a good practice.
