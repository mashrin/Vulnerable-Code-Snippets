The code appears to be vulnerable to Log Injection. In the injectLog method, the parameter passed as userInfo is concatenated with a string without any validation or formatting. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the log messages and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server. To prevent this, it is recommended to sanitize the input or use a secure logging library that handles input validation and formatting.
