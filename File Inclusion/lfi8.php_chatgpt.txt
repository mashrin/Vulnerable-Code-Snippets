The code is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) attacks. The vulnerability lies in the use of $_POST['file'] directly in the file_get_contents() function call without proper input validation. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to include and execute arbitrary files on the server. The code snippet attempts to prevent the inclusion of PHP source files by checking for the ".php" extension. However, this can easily be bypassed by appending "/." to the end of the file name, which makes the check invalid. 

To fix the vulnerability, the code should validate the input and make sure it only contains valid characters and file paths. One possible fix is to sanitize the input using PHP's realpath() function or a custom whitelist of acceptable file paths. Additionally, it's important to avoid relying on user input to access system resources and to limit the scope of file access to prevent unintended consequences.
