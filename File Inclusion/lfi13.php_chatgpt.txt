The main security vulnerability in this code snippet is a directory traversal vulnerability. The code uses the user input directly in the include statement without proper validation, and an attacker can use directory traversal techniques to include arbitrary files that are outside of the pages directory.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should perform input validation and sanitization on the user input before using it in the include statement. For example, the code can restrict the user input to a whitelist of allowed files. Additionally, the code can use a different approach to include files, such as using a switch statement or a lookup table to map user input to allowed files.
