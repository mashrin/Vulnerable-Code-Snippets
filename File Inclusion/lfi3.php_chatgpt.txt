Security vulnerabilities:

1. Directory traversal vulnerability: The code blindly includes the header.php file without any validation, which may allow an attacker to include any file from the file system, including sensitive files. 
2. Local file inclusion vulnerability: The code takes a file name from the GET parameter 'file' and includes its contents using the file_get_contents() function. This can be exploited by an attacker to include arbitrary files from the local file system, including sensitive files like /etc/passwd. 
3. Incomplete validation of file extensions: The code only checks if the file name provided in the 'file' parameter ends with '.php' or not. An attacker can bypass this check by using a file name like 'file.php/..../sensitive_file.txt' to include arbitrary files from the file system. 

Recommendations: 

1. Instead of blindly including the header.php file, the code should validate the file path and ensure that the file being included exists and has the expected content.
2. The code should sanitize the input file name to prevent directory traversal attacks and local file inclusion vulnerabilities.
3. The code should perform a more thorough validation of the file path, including checking whether the path is an absolute path, whether it contains any path traversal characters like '/../', and whether the included file has the expected content.
