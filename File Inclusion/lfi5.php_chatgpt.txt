One security vulnerability in this code snippet is the use of user input ($_GET['file']) directly in the include statement without proper validation. An attacker could exploit this by manipulating the "file" parameter to include arbitrary files from the server, potentially leading to sensitive data disclosure or unauthorized code execution.

Another vulnerability is the use of str_replace() to sanitize input. This method is not guaranteed to completely remove any instances of "../" and could be bypassed by an attacker to include files outside of the intended directory.

Finally, the hint provided in the comments suggests that the code requires the use of percent encoding for forward slashes, but this is not enforced in the code itself, leaving it vulnerable to attacks that use encoded path traversal sequences.
