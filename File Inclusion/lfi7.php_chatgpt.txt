The security vulnerabilities in this code snippet are:

1. Code Injection: The 'include' function is used with $_POST['library'] variable, which could be controlled by a malicious user to inject arbitrary code into the system.

2. Local File Inclusion (LFI) Attack: The code snippet is vulnerable to a local file inclusion attack, where the attacker can specify a malicious file path in $_POST['library'] and include it in the system. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, read sensitive files or even gain access to the entire system. 

3. Null Byte Injection: The hint provided in the code suggests that null byte (%00) can be used to bypass the file extension check. This can allow an attacker to include a malicious file with a disguised extension, which could cause unexpected behavior in the system. 

To fix these vulnerabilities, the code should validate the user input using a whitelist approach and avoid using user-controlled data in 'include' function. It's recommended to use absolute file paths instead of relative paths and sanitize the input using functions like realpath() or basename(). Additionally, the code should be protected against null byte injections by validating and sanitizing the input data.
