The main security vulnerability in this code is that there is no check to ensure that the user is authorized to see a particular secret. Any ID can be passed in the URL parameter, and the code will retrieve that secret without authorization, which can compromise the confidentiality of the data. The fix for this vulnerability is to add an authorization check to ensure that the user is authorized to access that secret. Additionally, the code should sanitize the input of the $id variable to prevent SQL injection attacks.
