One potential security vulnerability in this code is that it appears to contain hard-coded sensitive information (i.e. the empty strings passed as arguments to SQLConnect). This could be a potential security risk if an attacker gains access to the code or intercepts these values during transit. Additionally, it is unclear what steps are being taken to handle errors or unauthorized access attempts.
