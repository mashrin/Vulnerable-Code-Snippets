The security vulnerabilities in this code snippet are as follows:

1. The code is concatenating the username and password without sanitizing the input. This could lead to SQL injection attacks if an attacker provides malicious input that alters the SQL query.
2. The code is storing the password in plain text which is not secure. It is recommended to store the password in an encrypted format.
3. The code is not implementing proper error handling mechanisms. If the database connection fails, the code should provide a relevant error message to the user instead of crashing or displaying system errors.

To fix the above vulnerabilities, the following measures can be taken:

1. Sanitize the input by using parameterized queries or stored procedures to reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks.
2. Hash the password using a strong cryptographic hash function and store only the hashed value in the database. This will make it difficult for attackers to access the actual password even if they manage to breach the system.
3. Implement proper error handling by using try-catch blocks to catch exceptions and provide meaningful error messages to the user.
