There are several security vulnerabilities in this code:

1. The code imports many dangerous modules/functions that can be used for code execution such as `subprocess`, `pickle`, `marshal`, `popen2`, `code`, etc. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

2. There is a `black_type_list` defined which contains many dangerous functions that can be used for code execution such as `eval`, `execfile`, `open`, `os.popen`, etc. However, this list is not comprehensive and may not prevent all possible code executions.

3. The `loads` function uses `pickle` to deserialize data, which is dangerous and can be used to execute arbitrary code. The `loads` function has decorators to prevent certain functions in `black_type_list` from being called, but this is not a foolproof solution.

4. The code uses a secret key of 'you will never guess' which is not a secure way to generate a secret.

5. The `count` function is storing the number of requests made by a user in the session. This can be used to verify whether a user is attempting to perform a DOS attack.

6. The `calc_digest` function is using a simple hashing algorithm to calculate the digest of the data which is not secure.

7. The code is storing the location of the user in a cookie which can be tampered with by an attacker to gain access to sensitive information.

8. The `SECRET_KEY` is not used anywhere in the code and it is unclear why it is defined.

9. The `home` function is not checking if the user is authenticated or not before displaying sensitive information.

Overall, this code is highly vulnerable to code execution, data tampering, and other attacks. It needs to be rewritten with security in mind, using secure libraries and encryption, validating user input, and properly authenticating users.
