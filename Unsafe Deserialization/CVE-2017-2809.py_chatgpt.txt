1. The password is stored as a plain text variable, which can potentially be accessed by an attacker. This should be securely encrypted or hashed.
2. The code does not perform any input validation or sanitization, which could lead to injection attacks or malicious inputs.
3. The code uses the 'yaml.load' function without specifying any options, which can be dangerous as it can execute arbitrary code. A safer option would be to use 'yaml.safe_load'.
4. There is no error handling or logging for any potential issues that may arise during decryption or loading of the stream, which can make troubleshooting difficult and may lead to security breaches.
