2. The code does not perform input validation and sanitization for the $_GET['page'] parameter which can lead to a variety of security issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Remote Code Execution (RCE).
3. The code includes a filename that can be manipulated to disclose sensitive information or execute unauthorized code.
4. There is no error handling in case the file inclusion fails, which can lead to error messages that reveal sensitive information or assist attackers in performing a successful attack.
