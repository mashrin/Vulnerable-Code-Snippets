One security vulnerability in this code snippet is the use of node-serialize. This module can be used to deserialize attacker-controlled data, leading to code execution vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially modify the cookie's profile value to execute arbitrary code on the server. It is recommended to replace node-serialize with a safer alternative like JSON.stringify and JSON.parse.
