One potential vulnerability in this code is that there is no validation or sanitization of the `url` input parameter before it is passed to the `downloadURL` function. This could potentially allow an attacker to supply a malicious URL that could be used to perform a variety of attacks, such as a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack.

To fix this vulnerability, the application should validate and sanitize any input parameters before using them in any part of the code. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as regular expressions, input validation libraries, or custom validation functions.

Additionally, there are no error handling mechanisms in place for the `request` function, which could cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly if there are any issues during the request process. To address this, the application should include appropriate error handling and logging to ensure that any issues are detected and properly handled.
